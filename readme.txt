Java Eclipse Project

Sudoku Game is a simple Sudoku app built for Dr. Srividya Bansal's Software Enterprise I class in the Fall of 2011. The project served as an exercise in PSP (Personal Software Process, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Software_Process).

Sylvia primarily designed and built the GUI classes SudokuGame.java, SkillLevelSelection.java, and About.java. Ryan primarily designed and build the logic classes GameData.java and SquareData.java.
